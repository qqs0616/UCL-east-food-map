                As a new student in a large metropolis, it can be overwhelming to find a place to eat awesomely tasty
                food while studying so hard. Healthy nutrition doesnâ€™t mean eating pasta each evening while saving each
                penny. London is bursting with many great affordable places to eat and we want you to find them easier.
                UCL East is a new campus. The students have not been here before and are not familiar with the
                environment. Therefore, our website aims to show, compare and find cafes and restaurants within a
                3-miles radius of the new UCL campus.
